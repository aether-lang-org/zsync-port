# `-u` (base URL for a local .zsync) integration test. A .zsync generated
# without -u carries a *relative* URL (the input basename, like Go). When
# the client is handed such a .zsync as a LOCAL FILE, it needs a `-u` base
# to turn that relative URL into a fetchable one.
#
#   1. WITHOUT -u: local .zsync + relative URL -> resolves to a local path,
#      which is not fetchable -> failure.
#   2. WITH -u <base>: relative URL resolves against the base and the
#      download succeeds + reconstructs byte-identical.
#
# Needs python3 + network; run with the sandbox disabled.
